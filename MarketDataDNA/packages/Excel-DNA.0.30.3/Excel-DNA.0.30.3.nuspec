    <description>Excel-DNA eases the development of Excel add-ins using .NET. 
    Add-ins created with Excel-DNA can export high-performance user-defined functions and macros, and can be packed into a single file for easy distribution and installation.
 
    Excel versions 97 through 2010 can be targeted with a single add-in.
    Advanced Excel features are supported, including multi-threaded recalculation (Excel 2007 and later), registration-free RTD servers (Excel 2002 and later) and customized Ribbon and Task Pane interfaces (Excel 2007 and 2010) and asynchronous functions (Excel 2002 and later).

    Excel-DNA supports the .NET runtime version 2.0 (which is used by .NET versions 2.0, 3.0 and 3.5) and version 4.0 (the version number used by .NET 4 and 4.5). 

    The Excel-Dna Runtime is free for all use, and distributed under a permissive open-source license that also allows commercial use.</description>
